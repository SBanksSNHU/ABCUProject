So when I first started this project I knew that I wanted it to be a project 
for me to practice function pointers. I've done something similar before but since
I love learning, I wanted to solidify my knowledge on the topic a bit.

So starting out, I knew that the menu and courses would be presented by a class.
So I started making those.
